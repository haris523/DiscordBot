# DiscordBot
Discord bot is a small project which I worked on when you had to start subscribing to other bots, it can play music, and show you gifs or images based on your search queries. It's a great addition to your discord channel. Should be uploaded to a server so you don't have to run a local server every time for it to work.

# How to run?
Change the .env_sample file to .env and put your api keys inside
Download ffmpeg-4.1.3 folder and put it in base folder
Run npm install to get all the dependencies
Add botconfig.json as js object with your discord bot token and a prefix
The bot should now work.
